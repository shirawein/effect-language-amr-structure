# effect-language-amr-structure
Annotations for the LAW 2022 paper "Effect of Source Language on AMR Structure" (Wein et al., 2022).

Two annotators used the first 120 sentences and AMR structures from the test split of CAMR annotations of The Little Prince (which can be found at https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~clp/camr/camr.html), and translated the lexical items to their English equivalents. The detailed annotation process can be found in Section 3 of the paper.
